This project aims to predict credit card default payments using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic information and credit card payment history.
(Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Methods
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

## Results
The results show that model performance depends on the adaptation to the dataset rather than raw accuracy.
